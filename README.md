# Awesome Agentic Engineering Resources

> A curated list of high-signal resources — articles, books, courses, cookbooks, papers, playbooks, benchmarks, talks, podcasts, and newsletters — for agentic engineering and AI engineering.

This is a *resources* list, not a tools list. Open-source **tools** for building agentic systems live in the sister list [awesome-production-agentic-systems](https://github.com/EthicalML/awesome-production-agentic-systems); production ML tooling lives in [awesome-production-machine-learning](https://github.com/EthicalML/awesome-production-machine-learning). This list covers the *learning, design, and operational resources* that sit alongside those tools — including both:

- **Agentic engineering** — using AI agents to do software engineering (Copilot, Cursor, Claude Code, Aider, Cline, Windsurf, Codex; spec-driven development; context engineering; agent IDE rules and memory files; SWE benchmarks).
- **AI / agentic systems engineering** — building agentic and LLM-powered systems (architecture, RAG, memory, tool use & MCP, orchestration, multi-agent coordination, evaluation, observability, guardrails, safety, fine-tuning, inference, product/UX, economics, teams).

You can keep up to date by watching this repo for the monthly releases summarising newly added resources 🤩

This list was proposed in [EthicalML/awesome-production-machine-learning#709](https://github.com/EthicalML/awesome-production-machine-learning/issues/709) as a sister list focused on *resources* rather than tools.

## Topic Coverage Matrix

Resources are organised as a **matrix**: the top-level sections above (rows) are resource *types*, and each section is sub-divided by *topic*. The 21 topics, `T1`–`T21`, are shared across sections. This lets you read vertically ("what papers exist on RAG?") or horizontally ("where do I find resources on Coding Agents?").

**Topics:**

| # | Topic |
|---|---|
| T1 | Coding Agents & AI-Assisted Development (Copilot, Cursor, Claude Code, Aider, Cline, Windsurf, Codex) |
| T2 | Spec-Driven Development & Context Engineering (AGENTS.md, spec-kit, rules files) |
| T3 | Agent IDE Rules, Memory Files & Developer Workflows |
| T4 | SWE Benchmarks & Coding Evaluation |
| T5 | Autonomous Software Agents & Long-Horizon Engineering Tasks |
| T6 | LLM Application Architecture & System Design |
| T7 | Prompt Engineering |
| T8 | Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) |
| T9 | Memory Systems & Long-Context |
| T10 | Tool Use, Function Calling & MCP |
| T11 | Orchestration, Planning & Design Patterns |
| T12 | Multi-Agent Systems & Coordination |
| T13 | Evaluation & Testing |
| T14 | Observability, Tracing & Debugging |
| T15 | Guardrails & Security (prompt injection, jailbreaks, red-teaming) |
| T16 | Safety, Alignment & Responsible AI |
| T17 | Fine-tuning, Post-training, RLHF & Reasoning Training |
| T18 | Inference, Serving, Cost & Latency |
| T19 | Voice, Multi-modal & Embodied Agents |
| T20 | Product, UX & Human-AI Interaction Design |
| T21 | Economics, Teams, Hiring & Org Design |
