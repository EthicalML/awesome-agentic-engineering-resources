# Awesome Agentic Engineering Resources

> A curated list of high-signal resources — articles, books, courses, cookbooks, papers, playbooks, benchmarks, talks, podcasts, and newsletters — for agentic engineering and AI engineering.

This is a *resources* list, not a tools list. Open-source **tools** for building agentic systems live in the sister list [awesome-production-agentic-systems](https://github.com/EthicalML/awesome-production-agentic-systems); production ML tooling lives in [awesome-production-machine-learning](https://github.com/EthicalML/awesome-production-machine-learning). This list covers the *learning, design, and operational resources* that sit alongside those tools — including both:

- **Agentic engineering** — using AI agents to do software engineering (Copilot, Cursor, Claude Code, Aider, Cline, Windsurf, Codex; spec-driven development; context engineering; agent IDE rules and memory files; SWE benchmarks).
- **AI / agentic systems engineering** — building agentic and LLM-powered systems (architecture, RAG, memory, tool use & MCP, orchestration, multi-agent coordination, evaluation, observability, guardrails, safety, fine-tuning, inference, product/UX, economics, teams).

You can keep up to date by watching this repo for the monthly releases summarising newly added resources 🤩

This list was proposed in [EthicalML/awesome-production-machine-learning#709](https://github.com/EthicalML/awesome-production-machine-learning/issues/709) as a sister list focused on *resources* rather than tools.

## Topic Coverage Matrix

Resources are organised as a **matrix**: the top-level sections above (rows) are resource *types*, and each section is sub-divided by *topic*. The 21 topics, `T1`–`T21`, are shared across sections. This lets you read vertically ("what papers exist on RAG?") or horizontally ("where do I find resources on Coding Agents?").

**Topics:**

The **Trending / What's New**, **Milestones Timeline**, **Governance & Responsible AI**, **Product / UX / Economics**, and **Teams, Hiring & Org Design** sections collapse across topics and are presented as curated lists rather than matrix cells.
